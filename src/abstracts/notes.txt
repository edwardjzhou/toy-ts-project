// syntax of my files
the abstract idea of "DATA" is what I call a RECORD 
the RECORD in JS form is an OBJECT like { ...column keys(fields): record values, ...custom keys: derived values/joins } 
    *  ex: new Course() and it may have a course.tests custom key
the RECORD in SQL form is a ROW in a TABLE



// DB side:
// TABLE has ROWS of RECORDS

// CSV side: 
// .csv file has /n separated STRINGS of RECORDS

// on CODE side:
// MODEL (for each table)
// connects a db's TABLE to JS
// SHOULD ACTIVELY SANITIZE A RECORD, TYPE A RECORD, AND ADD CUSTOM COLUMNS OR OTHER SQL ops; BUT PERFORM NO OTHER LOGIC
// it also creates the join table relations with has_many belongs_to
// other viewpoint is that the TREND is to have fat models with more custom methods? skinny controllers
// activeRecord is abstraction for migrating (insert update set)

// SCHEMA is all tables FROM a db; or all models post object-ifying them? or during migration?
// SCHEMA = course schema + mark schema + ... 

// CONTROLLER 
// wrangles things for the view by having all the methods like class User {index () => User.all} 
or in our case prepares everything for the JSON view
